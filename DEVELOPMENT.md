# Development Notes

## Missing Features Analysis

Based on comprehensive analysis of the Rust structs vs. implemented NIF functions, the following features are not yet implemented in the Elixir wrapper:

### Technical Notes

- All features should follow the existing NIF pattern established in the codebase
- Rust implementations already exist in the main library
- Focus on exposing existing Rust functionality rather than reimplementing
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing wrapper functions

## Future Improvements
