# Development Notes

## Missing Features Analysis

Based on comprehensive analysis of the Rust structs vs. implemented NIF functions, the following features are not yet implemented in the Elixir wrapper:

### Lower Priority Features

#### 10. Pivot Table Enhancements

- **Extended Pivot Support**: Additional pivot table features
  - `CacheField` struct: Pivot cache field definitions
  - `CacheFields` struct: Collection of cache fields
  - `CacheSource` struct: Pivot data source management
  - `DataField` struct: Pivot data field configuration
  - `DataFields` struct: Collection of data fields

#### 11. Advanced Formatting

- **Extended Styling**: Additional formatting options
  - `ColorScale` struct: Color scale conditional formatting
  - `DataBar` struct: Data bar conditional formatting
  - `IconSet` struct: Icon set conditional formatting

### Technical Notes

- All features should follow the existing NIF pattern established in the codebase
- Rust implementations already exist in the main library
- Focus on exposing existing Rust functionality rather than reimplementing
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing wrapper functions
